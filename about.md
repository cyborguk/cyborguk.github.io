I'm Simon, and I'm based in the UK.

I like to use Open Source for hobby projects and I'm also fortunate to work in
an environment which uses Linux and Open Source software extensively.

This blog is a place for me to publish short journal pieces and longer-form
articles to document results of things I've been working on or thinking about.

This blog is produced using Jekyll, and uses the Hydeout theme. No trackers or
javascript are used on this site.

Instead of a comments section on this blog, I encourage you to toot at me on
[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@simon).
