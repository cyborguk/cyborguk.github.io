I've [written before](/2020/09/29/dark-patterns.html) about the cynical tactics
that companies employ to lock customers into their service, and restrict
choice. I like to read, and in our house we have a couple of e-ink ebook
readers - early generation Kindle and Kobo ones.
Over the years, despite knowing the [numerous](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47810367)
[risks](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jul/17/amazon-kindle-1984)
of owning DRM-restricted content, I seem to have picked up around 130 books,
picking up most of these when heavily discounted. I figured that these were
one-off, almost disposable low cost items - but over time, this has built into
a significant library. I enjoy using an e-ink reader on holiday, or outdoors in
summer, but more commonly I enjoy reading in bed at night on a tablet in dark
mode - something that can't be done with a real book with a sleeping spouse
beside you.

Which brings me to something that happened this week. The Kindle app on my
Android tablet stopped showing me DRM-restricted books. I tried removing the
app, deregistering, clearing cache and data from the app. Only DRM-free
books that I had bought elsewhere and sent to the Kindle app could be opened. I
initiated a chat session with Amazon. The support guy tried a few things, and
eventually closed all lines of enquiry with "in that case, your tablet in not
supported", even though it satisfies the requirements specified in the Google
Play Store, and that it worked last week. 

So that was it: Amazon had effectively taken away my content, since this was
the chief device on which I consumed it.

Yes, I know that with DRM content, you never "own the book, so don't come crying
to me when Amazon take your books away", et cetera, but if we put hard
boundaries around everything in life, we end up cutting off our nose to spite
our face sometimes. I'm an idealist who is also pragmatic. I like free software
but I also have some non-free software on my system. The pragmatic side of me
says that I wouldn't have read many of these books had it not been taking
opportunity of extreme price reductions. I prioritise reading as many ebooks as
I can through the local library app as a priority, but it doesn't have the
widest range of books, or may have long waiting times.

So where am I going with this? While I was aware of the risks, and tried to
quench the discomfort of cognitive dissonance I felt while "buying" these
ebooks, I probably didn't really think it would happen to me. It also didn't
happen the way I expected. And as I type this, I've just remembered - this
isn't even the first time - I paid for the *Shaun the Sheep* movie from Google
Play Store once, and it stopped working on my tablet soon after. Because this
was the only film in my library (usually would buy a DVD, or rent a time
limited stream), it hadn't really registered with me at the
time that this was a DRM issue, but yes, I've been mugged like this before
without really noticing. Of course, I could buy a new tablet, or in the case of
an ebook, make a DRM-free copy for personal use (even if it's legal in your
country, such a process is quite a faff) or install the app on my phone and use
a giant magnifying glass, but one day the app was working, and the next moment it
wasn't -  without any changes at my end. I suppose that taught me a
lesson: be prepared, it really *can* happen to you.
